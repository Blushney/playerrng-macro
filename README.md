# Blushney's Player RNG Macro 1.0.0

## Tutorial:

- Download [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
- Download the source zip

- Exctract the .zip file

- Go to the file's directory
- **Right click** on Run.ahk > Edit with Notepad

FROM THERE, listen carefully : 

- press ctrl + F on your keyboard, search "**your id**" and replace your id by your discord user id (**MAKE SURE TO REPLACE ALL THE "your id" THINGIES**)
- Once done, research "**your_installation_folde**r" and replace that by the path of your folder > Screenshot (where you extracted your .zip and add \Screenshot)
- After that, research "**your_webhook_ur**l" and replace this by your discord webhook (too long to explain on how to make one)

**AFTER YOU HAVE DONE ALL OF THIS, SAVE THE FILE WITH CTRL + S (or save it normally) AND THEN DOUBLE CLICK ON Run.ahk**

**IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS, SEND ME IN DMS/REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE WITH A SCREEN OF YOUR ERROR**

if you've done everything normally, go to roblox and check your discord for messages! (must put autoroll/autoclick)

**IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE PROGRAM**, GO TO YOUR **TASK MANAGER** SEARCH UP "auto" **AND TERMINATE THE TASK NAMED "AutoHotkey Unicode 64-bit"**
